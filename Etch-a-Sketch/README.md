# Etch-a-Sketch

https://leilannaeimi.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/

"Etch a Sketch" Project that I made by using HTML, CSS, Javascript. In this project, creating a toy to flex DOM manipulation skills. This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
The project uses JS to edit grid and mouse events to draw boxes.
