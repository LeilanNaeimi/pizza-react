<h1> Pizza</h1>

<p>Over the last while I have slowly been 
trying to free up some space in my freezer and I 
recently came across some pizza sauce that I had 
left over after making a pizza a while back. 
As soon as I stumbled upon it I remembered 
thinking that I had wanted to use it to
 make a hot cheesy pizza dip when I put
 it in the freezer. Once I had that thought there was no 
turning back and I was already dreaming up recipes for the dip.

<ul>Ingredients
<li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
<li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
<li>2 tbsps green pepper sliced</li>
<li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
<li>2 tbsps black olives sliced</li>
</ul>

<ol> Steps
<li>Mix the cream cheese, sour cream mayonnaise, mozzarella and parmesan and spread it across the bottom of a pie plate.</li>
<li>Spread the pizza sauce on top and sprinkle on the cheese, pepperoni, green pepper and olives.</li>
<li>Bake in a preheated 350F/180C oven until the sides are bubbling and the cheese cheese has melted and turned golden brown on top, about 20-30 minutes.</li>
