<p>Over the last while I have slowly been 
trying to free up some space in my freezer and I 
recently came across some pizza sauce that I had 
left over after making a pizza a while back. 
As soon as I stumbled upon it I remembered 
thinking that I had wanted to use it to
 make a hot cheesy pizza dip when I put
 it in the freezer. Once I had that thought there was no 
turning back and I was already dreaming up recipes for the dip.

<ul class="text">Ingredients
<li>Fine grain sea salt</li>
<li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
<li>Chopped avocado</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>Chopped herbs</li>
<li>3
big handfuls of sliced asparagus and/or pea shoots or tiny broccoli trees or shredded greens - anything quick cooking and fresh</li>
</ul>

<ol> Steps
<li>In a small bowl crack the eggs and beat them really well with a pinch of salt.
.</li>
<li>In a big skillet melt the oil and butter over medium high heat. If you're using a 
vegetable that might take longer to cook than others, add those to the pan - for example, 
asparagus or broccoli. Add a couple pinches of salt, stir, cover, and cook for a 
couple minutes. Until the vegetables are bright, and just cooked. Now stir in
 anything that just needs a quick flash of cooking - in this case pea greens,
 but chopped greens would go in at this point if you're using those.
 Stir, and cook just until tender - a minute or so. 
Pull about 1/3 of the vegetables out of the pan and set them aside.
<li>Now, add the pasta to the skillet, and toss well. Once the pasta is hot, turn down the heat, wait a moment, then quickly stir in the eggs. Stir well, then cover the pan, remove from heat, and let everything sit for a minute. Uncover, give everything another toss, the egg should be cooked through. Taste, and adjust the seasoning before dividing between two plates. Top with the reserved vegetables, and some chopped avocado.</li>
</ol>
